## File Location & Directory Structure

Every skill lives in its own directory under `skills/`:

```
skills/
  skill-name/
    SKILL.md          # Required: The skill definition
    LICENSE.txt       # Recommended: License terms
    references/       # Optional: Documentation loaded into AI context
      example-reference.md
    templates/        # Optional: Starter code that AI modifies
      example-template.md
    scripts/          # Optional: Executable automation
      example-script.sh
    assets/           # Optional: Static files used AS-IS in output
      example-asset.md
```

**Rules:**

- Every skill directory MUST contain exactly one `SKILL.md`
- The directory name MUST match the `name` field in frontmatter
- Empty directories are not allowed — remove or populate
- At most ONE of each subdirectory (`references/`, `templates/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`)

---

## Frontmatter Specification

### Required Fields

```yaml
---
name: skill-name-with-hyphens
description: "WHAT the skill does. Use when [specific trigger conditions]. KEYWORDS for matching."
---
```

### Field Rules

| Field         | Required | Rules                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | **Yes**  | Lowercase, hyphen-separated. Must match directory name. Maximum 64 characters.                                                                                                |
| `description` | **Yes**  | Single-quoted string. Must state WHAT the skill does (third person) followed by WHEN to use it (trigger conditions). Include KEYWORDS for discovery. Maximum 1024 characters. |
| `license`     | No       | SPDX identifier or reference to `LICENSE.txt`                                                                                                                                 |

### Description Anatomy

The `description` field is the **most critical field** for skill discovery. Agents discover skills by reading descriptions injected into their system prompt. A well-written description:

1. **Starts with capabilities** (third person, present tense): "End-to-end testing toolkit for..."
2. **Follows with triggers** (when to activate): "Use when asked to write, run, debug, or maintain..."
3. **Ends with keywords** (discovery terms): "...Covers browser automation, network interception, Page Object Model, fixtures, and parallel execution."

**Good:**

```yaml
description: "End-to-end testing toolkit using Playwright with TypeScript. Use when asked to write, run, debug, or maintain Playwright (@playwright/test) TypeScript tests for UI behavior, form submissions, user flows, API validation, or visual regression. Covers browser automation, Page Object Model, fixtures, and parallel execution."
```

**Bad:**

```yaml
description: "Playwright testing skill"
```

**Why it matters:** If the description is vague, the agent won't know when to activate the skill. If it contains process steps, the agent may follow the summary instead of reading the full SKILL.md.

---

## Required Sections

Every `SKILL.md` MUST include these sections in order:

```
# Skill Title

## Overview
## When to Use
## [Core Process / Workflow / Steps]
## Common Rationalizations
## Red Flags
## Verification
```

### Optional Sections (include when relevant)

- `## Prerequisites` — Required tools, dependencies, environment setup
- `## Configuration` — Configuration patterns and examples
- `## Troubleshooting` — Table of common problems and solutions
- `## CLI Quick Reference` — Command table for common operations
- `## References` — Links to supporting files
- `## Security Considerations` — When skill handles credentials, URLs, or sensitive data
- `## Anti-Patterns` — Table of things to avoid with explanations
- `## Examples` — Collapsible examples (use `<details>` to save tokens)

---

## Section Details

### Overview

**Purpose:** The elevator pitch. What does this skill do, and why should an agent follow it?

**Rules:**

- 1-2 sentences maximum
- Must answer: "What does this skill do?" and "Why is it important?"
- NO process steps in the overview — those belong in the Core Process section

**Example:**

```markdown
## Overview

Comprehensive toolkit for end-to-end testing of web applications using Playwright with TypeScript. Enables robust UI testing, API validation, and responsive design verification following industry best practices.
```

### When to Use

**Purpose:** Help agents and humans decide if this skill applies to the current task.

**Rules:**

- Bullet list of positive triggers ("Use when X")
- MUST include negative exclusions ("NOT for Y")
- Be specific about file types, tool names, and scenarios

**Example:**

```markdown
## When to Use

- Write E2E tests for user flows, forms, navigation, and authentication
- API testing via Playwright's `request` fixture or network interception
- Responsive testing across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- Debug flaky tests using traces, screenshots, videos, and Inspector

**NOT for:**

- Unit testing (use your framework's built-in test runner)
- Performance/load testing (use the `performance-testing-k6` skill)
- Visual regression with pixel-level comparison (use the `visual-regression-testing` skill)
```

### Core Process / Workflow / Steps

**Purpose:** The heart of the skill. The step-by-step workflow the agent follows.

**Rules:**

- Must be specific and actionable — not vague advice
- Use numbered steps for sequential workflows
- Use `test.step()` notation where it helps clarity
- Include code examples where they help (but keep them short)
- Use ASCII flowcharts where decision points exist
- Maximum 200 lines for the SKILL.md body (split larger content into `references/`)

**Good:** "Run `npx playwright test --reporter=html` and verify the exit code is 0"
**Bad:** "Make sure the tests pass"

**Good:** "Use `getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })` — priority 1 locator"
**Bad:** "Find the submit button"

### Common Rationalizations

**Purpose:** The most distinctive feature of well-crafted skills. These are excuses agents use to skip important steps, paired with factual rebuttals.

**Rules:**

- MUST be a markdown table with two columns: `Rationalization` and `Reality`
- Include at least 3 entries
- Every skip-worthy step in the Core Process needs a corresponding entry
- Be specific — generic entries like "I'll skip testing" are less useful

**Example:**

```markdown
## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization                                                | Reality                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "The login test is simple, I don't need the POM pattern"       | Simple tests grow complex. Without POM, a locator change breaks every test that touches login.                                         |
| "I'll add error handling after the tests pass"                 | Without error handling, test failures produce unhelpful stack traces. Add `test.step()` and proper assertions from the start.          |
| "This selector worked locally, it's fine for CI"               | CI environments have different timing and rendering. Always use stable locators (`getByRole`, `getByTestId`) and web-first assertions. |
| "Thread.sleep() is easier than explicit waits"                 | `Thread.sleep()` creates flaky tests that fail intermittently. Use `WebDriverWait` with `ExpectedConditions` for deterministic waits.  |
| "I'll skip the accessibility assertions, they're not critical" | WCAG compliance is a legal requirement in many jurisdictions. Use axe-core assertions from the start.                                  |
```

### Red Flags

**Purpose:** Observable signs that the skill is being violated. Useful during code review and self-monitoring.

**Rules:**

- Bullet list of behavioral patterns
- Must be detectable by reading code or reviewing test output
- Include at least 3 entries

**Example:**

```markdown
## Red Flags

- Using `Thread.sleep()` or `page.waitForTimeout()` instead of explicit waits / web-first assertions
- Importing Page Object classes directly in test files (should use fixtures/DI)
- Using CSS selectors (`locator('.btn')`) when role-based locators are available
- Tests that depend on execution order or shared mutable state
- Missing `@DisplayName` or test.step() descriptions in test output
- Hardcoded URLs, credentials, or environment-specific values
- No screenshot/trace capture configured for failing tests
```

### Verification

**Purpose:** Exit criteria. A checklist the agent uses to confirm the skill's process is complete.

**Rules:**

- MUST be a checklist using `- [ ]` syntax
- Every checkbox must be verifiable with evidence (test output, build result, file existence, etc.)
- Include at least 5 items
- Group by category when the checklist is long

**Example:**

```markdown
## Verification

After completing this skill's process, confirm:

- [ ] All tests pass: `npx playwright test` exits with code 0
- [ ] No `Thread.sleep()` or `waitForTimeout()` in any test file
- [ ] All locators follow priority order (role > label > placeholder > text > testId > CSS)
- [ ] Page Object Model used for any page with 3+ interactions
- [ ] test.step() used for multi-step test flows
- [ ] Screenshots/traces configured for failure capture
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials — all loaded from environment variables
- [ ] Test data uses placeholders or generated data (no real user data)
```

## Dual-Stack Patterns (Playwright + Selenium)

This repository is unique in supporting **two testing frameworks** side by side. Skills must account for this dual-stack nature.

### Skill Scope Classification

| Scope              | Convention                                                   | Example                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Playwright-only    | Prefix with `playwright-` or include "Playwright" in name    | `playwright-e2e-testing`                                                |
| Selenium-only      | Prefix with `webapp-selenium-` or include "Selenium" in name | `webapp-selenium-testing`                                               |
| Framework-agnostic | No framework prefix                                          | `qa-test-planner`, `qa-manual-istqb`                                    |
| Both frameworks    | Cover both in a single skill with clear sections             | `a11y-playwright-testing` + `accessibility-selenium-testing` (separate) |

### When to Use Separate Skills vs. Combined

**Use separate skills when:**

- The code examples are fundamentally different (TypeScript vs Java)
- The tooling and CLI commands are different
- The workflows diverge significantly

**Use a combined skill when:**

- The concepts are the same (test planning, ISTQB practices)
- The workflow is tool-agnostic
- The dual-stack nature is a small part of the content

### Dual-Stack Section Template

When a skill covers both frameworks, use this pattern:

```markdown
## Playwright (TypeScript)

<!-- Playwright-specific steps, code examples, and patterns -->

## Selenium (Java)

<!-- Selenium-specific steps, code examples, and patterns -->
```

Never mix Playwright and Selenium code in the same code block.

### Locator Strategy Tables

Each framework skill MUST include a locator priority table:

**Playwright:**

| Priority | Locator                | Example                                   |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Role + accessible name | `getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })` |
| 2        | Label                  | `getByLabel('Email')`                     |
| 3        | Placeholder            | `getByPlaceholder('Enter email')`         |
| 4        | Text                   | `getByText('Welcome')`                    |
| 5        | Test ID                | `getByTestId('submit-btn')`               |
| 6        | CSS (avoid)            | `locator('.btn-primary')`                 |

**Selenium:**

| Priority | Locator             | Example                                  |
| -------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1        | ID                  | `By.id("elementId")`                     |
| 2        | Test ID (CSS)       | `By.cssSelector("[data-testid='name']")` |
| 3        | Semantic CSS        | `By.cssSelector("nav > a.active")`       |
| 4        | Class               | `By.className("btn-primary")`            |
| 5        | XPath (last resort) | `By.xpath("//button[text()='Submit']")`  |

## Instructions Layer

This repository includes an `instructions/` layer that is unique to our structure. Instructions define **how to create and use agents and skills** — they are meta-guidelines, not executable skills.

### Instructions vs. Skills

| Aspect        | Skill                                                        | Instruction                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose       | Executable workflow for a specific task                      | Guideline for creating/using skills or agents       |
| Location      | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`                                     | `instructions/<name>.instructions.md`               |
| Frontmatter   | `name` + `description`                                       | `description` only                                  |
| Activation    | Automatic (description matching) or explicit (`/skill-name`) | Loaded by agents or referenced in agent frontmatter |
| Size limit    | ≤500 lines body                                              | ≤300 lines body                                     |
| Code examples | Yes, with runnable snippets                                  | Yes, but structural/pattern-focused                 |
| References    | Supported (`references/`, `templates/`)                      | Not supported (inline only)                         |

### Instructions Naming Conventions

| Pattern                                  | Example                                 | Purpose                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `<framework>-<language>.instructions.md` | `playwright-typescript.instructions.md` | Framework-specific coding standards |
| `<domain>.instructions.md`               | `a11y.instructions.md`                  | Domain-specific guidelines          |
| `<concept>.instructions.md`              | `agents.instructions.md`                | Meta-guidelines for repo concepts   |

## Supporting Files & Resource Types

### Resource Type Matrix

| Directory     | Purpose                                       | AI Interaction                 | Examples                                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `references/` | Documentation loaded into AI context          | Read and understood            | API guides, strategy docs, deep-dive explanations    |
| `templates/`  | Starter code that AI modifies and builds upon | Copied, filled, and customized | Test case templates, POM templates, config templates |
| `scripts/`    | Executable automation                         | Run when invoked               | Setup scripts, scaffolding, codegen helpers          |
| `assets/`     | Static files used AS-IS in output             | Read and included verbatim     | Sample data, example screenshots, reference images   |

### When to Create Supporting Files

Create supporting files ONLY when:

- Reference material exceeds 100 lines (keep the main SKILL.md focused on process)
- Code tools or scripts are needed for setup or scaffolding
- Checklists or templates are long enough to justify separate files
- The content would be reused across multiple skills

Keep patterns and principles **inline** when under 50 lines.

### Supporting File Frontmatter

Supporting files do NOT need frontmatter. They should start with:

```markdown
# File Title

> Part of the `[skill-name]` skill. See [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) for context.
```

## Progressive Disclosure Rules

Skills use a three-level loading model for efficiency:

```
Level 1: Discovery
  └─ Agent reads `name` + `description` from frontmatter
  └─ Decides whether to activate the skill

Level 2: Instructions
  └─ Agent reads full SKILL.md body
  └─ Follows the process/workflow

Level 3: Resources
  └─ Agent loads references/, templates/, scripts/ ONLY when needed
  └─ Triggered by explicit reference in the workflow
```

### Rules

1. **Level 1 must be self-contained.** The `description` field alone must tell the agent whether this skill applies. No external references.

2. **Level 2 must be actionable.** The SKILL.md body must contain enough information to execute the core workflow without loading any supporting files.

3. **Level 3 is demand-loaded.** References are loaded only when the agent reaches a step that says "See [Reference Name](./references/xxx.md) for detailed patterns." Never front-load all references.

4. **Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines.** If the body exceeds 500 lines, split content into `references/` files and link to them from the appropriate workflow step.

5. **Use collapsible sections** (`<details>`) for examples, extended code blocks, and supplementary content. This keeps the main content scannable while preserving detail.

### Progressive Disclosure Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                                        | Problem                                    | Fix                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Including full API docs in SKILL.md                 | Burns tokens, makes skill hard to scan     | Move to `references/` and link         |
| Loading all references upfront                      | Defeats the purpose of progressive loading | Reference only when needed in workflow |
| No description keywords                             | Agent can't discover the skill at Level 1  | Add trigger keywords to description    |
| Duplicating content between SKILL.md and references | Maintenance burden, token waste            | Link, don't duplicate                  |

## Reference File Rules

### Location

References are stored in `skills/<skill-name>/references/`, NOT at the project root.

### Content Rules

1. **One topic per file.** A reference file covers one subject (e.g., `locator_strategies.md`, NOT `playwright-guide.md` that covers everything).
2. **Maximum 300 lines per reference file.** If a topic exceeds 300 lines, split into multiple focused files.
3. **Must be linkable.** Every reference file must be referenced from at least one step in SKILL.md. Orphan references are dead weight.
4. **Use relative paths.** Always reference as `./references/file-name.md` or `./scripts/file-name.sh`. Never use absolute paths.
5. **Include a header.** Every reference file starts with a title and a back-link to SKILL.md.

### Reference File Template

## Template Rules

### Location

Templates are stored in `skills/<skill-name>/templates/`.

### Content Rules

1. **Templates are NOT documentation.** They are starter code/markup that AI agents copy, fill in, and customize.
2. **Use clear placeholders.** Mark placeholders with `[BRACKETS]` or `${VARIABLE}` syntax.
3. **Include instructions as comments.** Templates should have inline comments explaining what to fill in.
4. **Keep templates focused.** One template per deliverable type.
5. **Never put templates in `assets/`.** `assets/` is for static files used AS-IS. `templates/` is for files that AI modifies.

### Template vs. Asset Decision Tree

```
Does the file need to be modified/filled by the AI?
├─ YES → templates/
└─ NO → assets/
```

### Template File Template

```markdown
<!--

and remove the <!-- --> comments before finalizing.

## Anti-Rationalization Patterns

The `Common Rationalizations` section is the signature feature of well-crafted skills. This section documents the excuses agents make to skip important steps, paired with factual rebuttals.

### Why This Matters

AI agents are prone to:

1. **Shortcut-seeking:** "This is simple enough to skip the full process"
2. **Over-optimism:** "I'll add tests later"
3. **Pattern-matching to simplicity:** "I've seen similar code, I know what to do"
4. **Avoiding tedious steps:** "The manual verification isn't necessary"

The rationalizations table pre-empts these behaviors by providing the agent with built-in counter-arguments.

### Pattern for Writing Rationalizations

For each skip-worthy step in your Core Process, ask:

1. **What excuse would an agent use to skip this step?** → That's the `Rationalization`
2. **What factually goes wrong when this step is skipped?** → That's the `Reality`

### QA-Specific Rationalizations

Include these QA-specific entries where applicable:

| Rationalization                                                | Reality                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I'll test just the happy path, edge cases can wait"           | Edge cases are where 60% of production bugs originate. Test boundary values, empty inputs, and error states from the start. |
| "The test passes locally, CI must be flaky"                    | CI failures often reveal real environmental issues (timing, rendering, dependencies). Investigate before dismissing.        |
| "This selector is stable enough"                               | Selectors based on CSS classes or XPath break on the next UI redesign. Use role-based locators or `data-testid` attributes. |
| "I don't need to test this in multiple browsers"               | Cross-browser differences account for 15-20% of UI bugs. At minimum, test Chromium + Firefox.                               |
| "Manual testing covered this, no need to automate"             | Manual testing doesn't scale and isn't repeatable. Automate regression-critical paths.                                      |
| "The API response looks right, no need to validate the schema" | Without schema validation, implicit breaking changes pass silently. Validate response structure, not just values.           |
| "I'll skip the wait strategy, the element loads fast enough"   | "Fast enough" is not a synchronization strategy. Use explicit waits / web-first assertions for deterministic behavior.      |
| "Page Object Model is overkill for this test"                  | Tests without POM become unmaintainable after 20+ test cases. Even simple pages benefit from encapsulated locators.         |

## Cross-Skill References

Reference other skills by name using inline code format:

```markdown
Follow the `playwright-e2e-testing` skill for writing Playwright tests.
For Selenium patterns, use the `webapp-selenium-testing` skill.
If the build breaks, use the `playwright-regression-testing` skill for diagnosis.
For test planning, activate the `qa-test-planner` skill.
```

### Cross-Reference Rules

1. **Never duplicate content between skills.** If two skills need the same information, put it in one skill's `references/` and link from the other.
2. **Reference by skill name, not file path.** Use `` `skill-name` `` not `skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`.
3. **Keep references directional.** Avoid circular references (Skill A references Skill B which references Skill A).
4. **Document cross-references in SKILLS-INDEX.md.** If a skill references another skill, add it to the dependency map.

---

## Writing Principles

1. **Process over knowledge.** Skills are workflows, not reference docs. Steps, not facts. An agent reading the skill should know exactly what to DO.

2. **Specific over general.** "Run `npx playwright test --reporter=html`" beats "verify the tests pass". "Use `getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })`" beats "find the submit button".

3. **Evidence over assumption.** Every verification checkbox requires proof. "All tests pass" must be backed by "exit code is 0" or "HTML report shows 0 failures".

4. **Anti-rationalization.** Every skip-worthy step needs a counter-argument in the Common Rationalizations table. If agents routinely skip a step, document why they shouldn't.

5. **Progressive disclosure.** Main SKILL.md is the entry point. Supporting files are loaded only when the workflow reaches a step that references them.

6. **Token-conscious.** Every section must justify its inclusion. If removing it wouldn't change agent behavior, remove it.

7. **Dual-stack aware.** When writing a skill that could apply to both Playwright and Selenium, clearly separate the content. Never mix TypeScript and Java in the same code block.

8. **QA-domain specific.** This repository is for QA Automation Engineers. Write for that audience — assume familiarity with testing concepts (POM, assertions, fixtures, test data management).

# Playwright Visual Regression Testing

## Overview

Toolkit for implementing visual regression testing using Playwright's built-in screenshot comparison. Ensures UI consistency across changes with configurable thresholds and masking.

## When to Use

- Implement visual regression tests with `toHaveScreenshot()`
- Configure comparison thresholds and maxDiffPixelRatio
- Mask dynamic content (timestamps, ads, avatars) in screenshots
- Debug screenshot diff failures
- Manage baseline images across CI environments

**NOT for:**

- Pixel-perfect design QA (use dedicated design review tools)
- Accessibility testing (use the `a11y-playwright-testing` skill)

## Core Process

1. **Identify visual regression scope**
   - List pages/components that need visual testing
   - Identify dynamic content that must be masked
   - Determine threshold sensitivity per component

2. **Create baseline screenshots**

   ```typescript
   await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot("homepage.png");
   ```

3. **Configure comparison options**

   ```typescript
   await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot("homepage.png", {
     maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.01,
     mask: [page.locator(".dynamic-content")],
   });
   ```

4. **Run and review**

   ```bash
   npx playwright test --update-snapshots  # First run (create baselines)
   npx playwright test                      # Subsequent runs (compare)
   ```

5. **Handle failures**
   - Review diff images in HTML report
   - If intentional change: update baseline with `--update-snapshots`
   - If regression: fix the UI change and re-run

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization                                       | Reality                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Visual tests are too flaky to be useful"             | Flakiness comes from unmasked dynamic content and missing thresholds. Configure properly and visual tests become one of the most reliable regression detectors. |
| "I'll update the baseline without reviewing the diff" | Blind baseline updates defeat the purpose of visual testing. Always review the diff image before accepting changes.                                             |
| "One global threshold is enough for all pages"        | Different pages have different complexity. A 1% threshold may be fine for a static landing page but too loose for a data dashboard.                             |

## Red Flags

- Baseline images updated without reviewing diff output
- No masking for dynamic content (dates, ads, user-specific data)
- Visual tests disabled in CI pipeline
- Using full-page screenshots for components (use `.toHaveScreenshot()` on specific locators)
- Threshold set to 0 (any pixel change fails — too brittle for CI)

## Verification

- [ ] Baseline screenshots exist for all pages/components under test
- [ ] Dynamic content is masked with `mask` option
- [ ] Threshold configured appropriately per component complexity
- [ ] Visual tests run in CI alongside functional tests
- [ ] Diff images reviewed before baseline updates
- [ ] Test report includes comparison images for all failures
